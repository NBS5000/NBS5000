## I'm Steve 

### Thanks for having a look at my Github

I'm a web developer.

I've been doing it for a while now, about 10 years or so, and I love what I do.ï»¿

I'm back in the job market and am looking for an organisation that I can really throw myself in to and make a difference.

Could that be you? Maybe.

If you're interested in working with me, check out [My Site](https://steve.darthsteve.au/) or email me at [nbs5000.dev@gmail.com](mailto:nbs5000.dev@gmail.com)
